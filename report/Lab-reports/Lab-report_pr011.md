# Enterprise Linux Lab Report

- Student name: Dylano
- Github repo: <https://github.com/HoGentTIN/elnx-USER.git>
- Goal: Setting up a File-server with Samba/vsftpd

Describe the goals of the current iteration/assignment in a short sentence.

## Test plan

The server can be accurately tested with the test script by executing `sudo /vagrant/test/runbats.sh` and it will go through the correct testfolder(name of the server) and will execute the '.bats' files.
In this case,the testfiles will be in `/vagrant/test/pr011`

## Procedure/Documentation

## Test report

The test report is a transcript of the execution of the test plan, with the actual results. Significant problems you encountered should also be mentioned here, as well as any solutions you found. The test report should clearly prove that you have met the requirements.
